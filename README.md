# cmd_box

When you want to open a shell on a remote system but you don't want to open a process called cmd.
The python file is an example on how to call the dll.
I'm going to add features so stay tuned!

## Features

- Takes you string like you'd expect cmd to do  
- Checks if the app you mentioned exists on the C:\Windows and C:\Windows\System32 directories
- Lightweight, minimal and easy to change according to your needs

---

## To do

- Usage of the PATH variables for better compatibility
- Obfuscation of the strings for more stealth
